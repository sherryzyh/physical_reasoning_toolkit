      "question": "A smooth horizontal shaft at a height $h$ from the ground is smoothly connected to a lightweight board of length $2L$. The shaft is fixed at the center of the board. A long, thin string is placed on the board, with a mass per unit length of $\\lambda$. The lightweight board is sufficiently rough such that the string does not slip on its surface. The remaining part of the string is piled on the ground, and the suspended string does not experience any tension from the string pile. Initially, the system is in equilibrium.\n\nLet $\\theta$ be the angle of rotation counterclockwise from the equilibrium position. At time $t=0$, a small impulse is applied to the right side of the board, giving it an initial angular velocity $\\omega_{0} = \\sqrt{\\alpha g/L} \\left(\\alpha \\ll 1\\right)$ in the counterclockwise direction, after which the board begins to oscillate. Since $\\alpha \\ll 1$ and $|\\theta| \\ll 1$, it can be approximated that the strings on both the left and right sides remain vertical. Let the tensions exerted on the endpoints of the board by the hanging strings on the left and right be $T_{l}$ and $T_{r}$, respectively. The gravitational acceleration is given as $g$.\n\nGiven $h = L/3$, find the time $T_{1/2}$ required for the average amplitude of the board to decay to half of its original value.",
