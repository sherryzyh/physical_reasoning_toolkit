      "question": "The civilization of *Three-Body* changes the values of fundamental physical constants, such as the Planck constant, inside the \"water drop\" to alter the range of strong forces.  \nWhat kind of effects would this produce? This problem provides a suitable discussion about this question.  \n\nHideki Yukawa pointed out that the propagator of nuclear forces is the $\\pi$ meson. One can equivalently simplify the effect by considering that protons and protons, protons and neutrons, and neutrons and neutrons have an identical strong-force potential energy. For a force field with a propagator of mass, Yukawa potential and its range can be expressed as:  \n\n$$\nU = -\\frac{A\\mathrm{e}^{-\\frac{2\\pi m c r}{h}}}{r}\\quad,\\quad\\lambda = \\frac{h}{2\\pi m c}\n$$  \n\nFor the deuteron (the strong-force binding between a proton and a neutron), consider two particles rapidly rotating around the center of mass. If the distance between the proton and the neutron is precisely $r$ and they do not collide, find the angle rotated around the center of mass during one complete cycle of small radial oscillation. Express the answer in terms of $\\lambda$ and $r$.",
