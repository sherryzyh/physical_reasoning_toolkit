    "question": "Xiao Ming discovered an elliptical plate at home with semi-major and semi-minor axes of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), respectively. Using one focus \\( F \\) as the origin, a polar coordinate system was established such that the line connecting the focus and the vertex closest to the focus defines the polar axis direction. Through extremely precise measurements, it was found that the mass surface density satisfies the equation \\(\\sigma = \\sigma_{0}(1 + e\\cos\\varphi)^3\\), where \\( e \\) is the eccentricity of the ellipse. When the plate's major axis is positioned vertically and released from rest on a sufficiently rough tabletop, the plate moves only within the plane it lies in. Find the angular acceleration \\(\\beta\\) of the plate when the major axis becomes horizontal.",
