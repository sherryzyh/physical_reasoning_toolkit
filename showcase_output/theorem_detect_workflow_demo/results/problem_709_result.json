    "question": "In a zero-gravity space, there is a ring made of a certain material, with a radius of $R$, density $\\rho$, Young's modulus $E$, and a circular cross-section with a radius of $r$ ($r \\ll R$). The center of the ring is stationary in a rotating reference frame with an angular velocity $\\Omega$, and the normal of the ring is in the same direction as $\\Omega$. $\\Omega$ is much smaller than the natural frequency of the ring's vibration. A perturbation is applied, causing vibrations on the ring. Considering a standing wave solution of order $m$, it is known that the antinodes of the standing wave will precess. Find the precession angular velocity $\\delta\\omega$. The positive direction is defined to be the same as $\\Omega$.  Ignore motion perpendicular to the plane of the ring; the order $m$ indicates that the displacement has the form of $\\cos(m\\theta)$ or $\\sin(m\\theta)$.\n",
