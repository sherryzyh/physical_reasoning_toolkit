    "question": "In a zero-gravity space, infinitely far above a conductive plate with thickness $D$ and conductivity $\\sigma$, there is a small magnet with its pole facing the plate. The magnet is incident from infinity with an initial velocity $v_0$. The magnet has a magnetic moment $\\mu$, mass $m$, and the vacuum permeability is $\\mu_0$. Neglect the magnetic fields generated by changing electric fields and conductive currents. Find the final stop position of the small magnet and the distance from the plate $h_e (h_e \\gg D)$.",
